# CS222FinalProj

1 Proposal
Our goal in this project is to create a functional clone of level 1-1 in Super
Mario. We will achieve this by splitting work into three categories: Physics
Engine, Graphics, and Game Logic. Each of these categories will be handled by
a separate individual. Li An will code the Physics, Serena will code Graphics,
and Brennan will code the Game Logic.

2 Physics Engine
The physics engine category includes implementing various physics rules like
velocity, acceleration, gravity, friction, and collision. Most elements in game
should obey the really world physics, but some elements may not, so the physics
engine also should have some flexibility.

3 Graphics
After working a lot with the graphics in CP 122 for my Tetris project I thought
it would be interesting to work on the graphics for this project in hopes to
optimize what I already know and learned from Tetris. My goals is to have a
functioning GUI that works well with the rest of the project as well as looks
nice. I think the biggest challenge will be working with Java Swing and getting
the GUI to produce what I want, but I hope that part goes more smoothly after
my background with Tetris.

4 Game Logic
My goal is to integrate and apply the physics engine and graphics in order to
create function gameplay. This will be done by creating the level(s) in a file that
can be called upon to create the gui for the player. I will also be integrating
enemy behavior and player-enemy interaction, which ties into the score and
timer elements I shall also be creating.


5 Success Parameters and Extra Resources
This project is intended to create a platformer clone of Super Marioâ€™s 1-1. If the
gameplay is functional and similar to the gameplay of the original game, then
we will have completed our job. As of right now, our only extra resources that
we plan to import stem from javax.swing (gui) and the Math class (physics).

6 Biggest Challenges
Physics: Smooth animation for movement and collisions Graphics: Proper scal-
ing of objects and creating different frames for movement of characters Game
Logic: Integrating the aforementioned classes into a coherent and appealing
game experience.
